Research Interest
1.	Evolutionary and functional genomics in plants and fungi – the development of sequencing technology has given rise to a wealth of genomic information for living organisms. Using these data and the sequencing technologies, I try to understand critical questions in the evolution and biology of plants and fungi, such as a) the nature of adaptive traits that allowed the first plants to survive the challenges of life on land; and b) genome signature and adaptation that enabled multi-kingdom endosymbiosis between AM fungi and plants/bacteria. 
2.	Application of NGS technologies and bioinformatics in crop improvement – I am interested in using NGS technologies in combination with bioinformatics and population genetics approach to identify key genes that control important agronomic traits to facilitate crop improvement. We have developed tools and pipelines for such task and applied to a number of crops including apple and spinach.  
3.	Hierarchical gene regulation – regulation of gene expression is a complexed process that involves multi-layered activities. I am interested in using RNA-Seq and ribosome footprint profiling to investigate plant transcriptional and translational regulation of gene expression in response to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses.
